# SwaggerExample

Just a very quick example swagger.json to get started with Swagger. I created the file for my talk on 1/19/17. It includes a couple of example paths: one "get", one "post." It also includes a simple security definition for header based "api_key"  authentication.

Swagger.json tested across Swagger Editor and Swagger UI. I wanted to make sure I had a very basic working copy before expanding.

#### The SwaggerPresentation.pdf file is a copy of my slides that includes references to Swaggers resources and tutorials.
