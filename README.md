# SwaggerExample

Just a very quick example swagger.json to get started with Swagger. I created the file for my talk on 1/19/17. It includes a couple of example paths: one "get", one "post." It also includes a simple security definition for header based "apiKey"  authentication.

Tested across Swagger Editor and Swagger UI.

The talk is available at https://joind.in/talk/42578
